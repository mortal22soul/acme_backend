### `index.ts`

The `OpenAPIHono` class is used to generate OpenAPI documentation from the routes in the trips module.

The `tripRouter` instance is created from the OpenAPIHono class.

`tripRouter` is exported and mounted at `/trips` in the main router.

The `tripRouter.openapi` method is used to generate OpenAPI documentation for each route in the `trips` module.

The `tripRouter.openapi` method takes two arguments

- the route handler function and
- a callback function that returns the response.

The callback function is an async function that takes a context object `c` as an argument.

The context object `c` contains the request and response objects.

The route handler function is called with the context object c.

The route handler function is responsible for handling the request and returning a response.

The OpenAPI documentation is generated based on the route handler function and the response returned by the callback function.

### `routes.ts`

The createRoute function is a helper function that creates a route definition object.

It takes an object with the following properties:

- `method` : The HTTP method for the route.
- `path` : The path for the route.
- `summary` : A short description of what the route does.
- `tags` : An array of tags that the route belongs to.
- `security` : An array of security requirements for the route.
- `request` : An object with the request schema.
- `responses` : An object with response schemas for different status codes.

The request and responses properties can have nested objects with schemas for different parts of the request and response.

The schemas are defined using the `hono/zod-openapi` library, which provides a way to define OpenAPI schemas using TypeScript.
